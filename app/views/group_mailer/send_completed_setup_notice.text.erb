Dear <%= @user.name %>,
  
<%= @group.display_name %> has been assigned the unique URL <%= @url %>
  
Students can now join this group by going to the group page and clicking “Request to Join Group”. As each student registers, you will be sent an email to confirm that they are a member of the group.

You will need to assign a Student Administrator to the group. Each group should have one student and one adult administrator assigned. Student Administrators have the ability to send group messages, edit group information and moderate postings on your group’s page.

Don’t forget:

- Start posting! The goal of the Say What! group collaboration site is to share ideas, projects, events, and resources with other groups across the state. The more you post, the more information there is to pull from!

- Apply for a mini-grant. The Department of State Health Services has provided funds for mini-grants of up to $500 to help promote tobacco prevention efforts through the Say What! movement. Click here to apply now!

Thanks,

Say What! Site Admin
