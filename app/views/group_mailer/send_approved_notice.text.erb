Dear <%= @user.name %>,

Congratulations, <%= @group.display_name %> is now confirmed on the Say What! group collaboration site!

As the group's Adult Administrator you have the responsibility to monitor the content of your group's page and the postings of your group members. You will have the ability to approve membership requests, send a message to all registered users in your group, edit group information, and mark items for deletion. Items that are marked for deletion will be confirmed with you by the Site Administrator before they are deleted.

Next Steps:

- Set up the group page. When you log in you will be asked to select a unique URL for the group's page. This URL will point directly to the group page and can be used to promote upcoming events and share limited information about the group with non-registered users.

- Complete your profile. Visit <%= @url %> to log in to your profile. You will be able to tell us a little bit about yourself in the bio section and upload a profile picture. 
    
Remember: do not share any personal information (home address, phone number, etc.) on the internet.

Please let us know if you have questions,

Say What! Site Admin
