Dear <%= @user.name %>,

Congratulations, <%= @group.display_name %> is now confirmed on the Say What! group collaboration site!
  
<%= @group.display_name %> has been assigned the unique URL <%= @url %>

As the group's Adult Administrator you have the responsibility to monitor the content of your group's page and the postings of your group members. You will have the ability to approve membership requests, send a message to all registered users in your group, edit group information, and mark items for deletion. Items that are marked for deletion will be confirmed with you by the Site Administrator before they are deleted.
  
Students can now join this group by going to the group page and clicking “Request to Join Group”. As each student registers, you will be sent an email to confirm that they are a member of the group.

You will need to assign a Student Administrator to the group. Each group should have one student and one adult administrator assigned. Student Administrators have the ability to send group messages, edit group information and moderate postings on your group’s page.

Don’t forget:

- Start posting! The goal of the Say What! group collaboration site is to share ideas, projects, events, and resources with other groups across the state. The more you post, the more information there is to pull from!

- Apply for a mini-grant. The Department of State Health Services has provided funds for mini-grants of up to $500 to help promote tobacco prevention efforts through the Say What! movement. Click here to apply now!

Remember: do not share any personal information (home address, phone number, etc.) on the internet.

Please let us know if you have questions,

Say What! Site Admin
