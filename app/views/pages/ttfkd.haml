    %h2.heading Texas Tobacco-Free Kids Day 03-21-12

    %p <img src="/resources/img/downloads/TTFKD-Logo.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 18px 0 0;"> Get your school ready for TTFKD 2012 now! Your school can do something as simple as broadcasting tobacco-free messages on announcements or as elaborate as organizing students for a major educational activity.

    %p Texas Tobacco-Free Kids Day (TTFKD) is an annual awareness day in Texas to encourage students of all ages to live tobacco-free lifestyles. Sponsored by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) and the Texas School Safety Center (TxSSC), the goal of this year's event on March 21, 2012, is to get every school in Texas involved in the effort to help children make healthy choices by not using tobacco.

    %p TTFKD is held in conjunction with Kick Butts Day, a national event sponsored by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The day is an annual celebration of youth leadership and activism in tobacco prevention efforts. On Kick Butts Day, thousands of youth will organize activities to expose and counter the tobacco industry's powerful promotional strategies aimed at youth. Some of the past activities include youth-led rallies in state capitals, surveys of tobacco advertising in local stores and street activism events.
