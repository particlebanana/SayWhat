Dear <%= params['application']['adult_name']%>,
  
Thank you for completing the online mini-grant application.

In order to process any payments, you must be registered as a Texas State University vendor. Please download the Texas State University Vendor Maintenance Form here and fax back to Lindy Narvaiz at 512-245-1465. 

DO NOT fax the Vendor Form back to the number on the form as it will delay the process. Your application is not considered completed until we receive the Vendor Form.

If you have not heard from our office within 5 working days of faxing your Vendor Form, please email info@txsaywhat.com.

Thanks,

Ruby Moore,
